## GitlabUpdater

A bot designed to copy qualifying comments from a Discord channel to an
issue in a particular Gitlab repository.

Unlike Github, Gitlab is not free for everyone. Gitlab is a better place
to record discussions than Discord but giving everyone who wants to
participate a Gitlab userid in your project repo may not be practical.
This bot allows everyone with a userid in your Discord server to add 
comments to issues in your project. It's not perfect but it encourages
greater participation.

### Usage

* Install the bot in your server and enroll the bot user in the channel
you want to copy comments from.
* Prefix comments you want to copy to Gitlab with the magic string
(default is '##') and the issue number, eg:
```
## 219 This is a good idea but we need to be careful with licensing 
restrictions. The original is CC-SA but blah blah blah. More blah. Even
a great big text wall. Once upon a time in a land far far away lived a
little goblin called Fred. Fred had a pet wombat. The wombat was very
vicious and the subject of multiple restraining orders. All of which he
ignored because he was a wombat and therefore had no concept of legal
niceties like restraining orders. Blah blah blah.
```
* The bot will see the message and attempt to update the specified issue
and report the result in a person-friendly way.
* The bot does not see edited messages so you can't edit a comment to
include the issue number after it's been posted. You would need to copy
and paste the message again, remembering to prefix it with the magic
string and the issue number.
